Hello there!
                </h1>
                <p>
Welcome to my portfolio! I am a french graphics programmer, hard worker and Tolkien nerd.<br/>
                </p>
<i><b>What is this website about?</b></i>
                <p>
I'm glad you asked. This website is basically a Résumé, but with a lot more details and personal thoughts than your regular CV.</br>
I also talk more in-depth about the different projects I have worked on, and what the taught me.<br/>
I was also thinking about writing some blog posts about game development and computer graphics. But I don't believe it has its place in a Github website.
                </p>
                <p>
If you want to have an idea on what I've done so far, you can have a look at the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page where I talk in detail about all the games I've worked on.
You can also have a look at my <a href="resume.html">résumé</a> which is basically a condensed version of this portfolio.
                </p>
                <p>
I am currently working at a company called <a href="http://www.virtuosgames.com/">Virtuos</a>, well known in the game industry for providing various art assets to AAA games and movies.
But also for making remasters and portings of great titles such as : <a href="projects.html#lanoire_vr">L.A. Noire VR</a>, <a href="projects.html#ezio_collection">The Ezio collection</a> and Batman: Return to Arkham.</br>
                </p>
                <p>
In 2015, I graduated with a DUT (french equivalent of a HNC) in computer science. During my studies,
I did a 6 months work placement in a video game company called <a
href="http://www.teleportationexpertise.com" target="_blank">Polm Studio</a> 
(I know it doesn't look like it, but they used to make games), working on a mobile game called 
<a href="projects.html#maya_wars">Maya Wars</a> on Android and iOS.
                </p>
                <p>
During my free time, I love learning about computer graphics and programming in general. I even like making shaders for fun.
You can have a look on my creations on <a title="Prepare to be amazed" href="https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Gaktan">shadertoy</a>.
I am working on my own little game called <a href="projects.html#wolfen_doo">Wolfen-Doo</a>,
a mix between Wolfenstein 3D and Scooby-doo.
I also like challenging myself with programming problems and games.
                </p>
                <p>
Like most people in the game industry, I like playing games. My favourites include the Monkey Island series
and the Grand Theft Auto series. I also like watching movies (big fan of Scorsese), coding for fun,
and sometimes I even go outside on a walk. I also very recently started playing american football.
                </p>
                <p>
I would love to discuss about job opportunities, projects I am currently
working on, worked on, or even fish memes if that's what you are into.
