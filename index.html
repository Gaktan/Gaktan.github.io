Hello there!
                </h1>
                <p>
It just so happens that you came across Gaëtan Monnier's portfolio. I am a french video game programmer,
hard worker and Tolkien nerd. 

Here you can have a look on my <a href="resume.html">résumé</a> and there you can find a few
                    <a href="projects.html">projects</a> I've worked on.
                </p>
                <p>
I am currently looking for a job as a video game prorammer, mostly wanting to be a gameplay developer.
                </p>
                <p>
In 2015, I graduated with a DUT (french equivalent of a HNC) in computer science. During my studies,
I did a 6 months work placement in a video game company called <a
href="http://www.teleportationexpertise.com/index_English.html" target="_blank">Polm Studio</a> 
(I know it doesn't look like it, but they actually make games too), working on a mobile game called <a
href="projects.html#maya_wars">Maya Wars</a> on Android and iOS.
                </p>
                <p>
During my free time, I am working on my own little game called <a href="projects.html#wolfen_doo">Wolfen-Doo</a>,
a mix between Wolfenstein 3D and Scooby-doo. But I'm also doing a lot of research on my own,
and learning about real time engines, openGL, and video game programming in general.
But I also like challenging myself with programming problems and games.
                </p>
                <p>
Like most people in the game industry, I like playing games. My favourites include the Monkey Island series
and the Grand Theft Auto series. I also like watching movies (big fan of Scorsese), coding for fun,
and sometimes I even go outside to have a run.
                </p>
                <p>
I would love to <a href="contact.html">discuss</a> about job opportunities, projects I am currently
working on, or worked on, fish memes, or about whatever questions are on your mind.
