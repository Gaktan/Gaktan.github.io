The Ezio Collection
				</h1>
				<p>
<a href="http://assassinscreed.ubi.com/en-US/games/ezio-trilogy/" target="_blank">The Ezio Collection</a> is a pack of three AAA games
(Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed: Revelations). Released on November 15th, 2016.
				</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Platforms</th>
						<td>PS4, Xbox One</td>

						<td>C++, HLSL (shaders)</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
This is the first AAA project I have ever worked on. And a quite exciting one since I absolutely love these three games. It was
a real pleasure and honnor to have the priviledge to work on them. I never thought I ever would. Overall this was a great opportunity for me
				</p>
				<p>
But also a real challenge. It was my first time working on consoles and a project that complex. The biggest difficulty was to understand
the engine, that means understanding what the programmers who originally designed the engine intended to do with it.
				</p>
				<p>
The gameplay, system, and core parts of each game were left untouched. Only the engine and graphics engine were to be changed, and I mainly worked on the graphic engine.
				</p>
				<p>
My main task on this project was to port Assassin's Creed II from PS3/XBOX360 to current gen console, and mainly PS4.
But here is a non exhaustive list of what I did on this project:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>4K checkerboard implementation on PS4 Pro for all three games.</li>
					<li>Refactoring of the graphics engine.</li>
					<li>Multithreaded rendering.</li>
					<li>Porting eventual upgrades from Assassin's Creed Revelations</li>
					<li>Modern post effects.</li>
					<li>HDAO (High Definition Ambient Occlusion).</li>
					<li>Fixing tons of bugs and crashes (as well as a few already present in the original game).</li>
				</ul>

Wolfen-doo

Wolfen-Doo is the game I'm currently working on. I aim to bring the odd blend the Wolfenstein 3D style
into the Scooby-Doo universe.

						<th>Platforms</th>
						<td>PC (possibly Linux and Mac as well since it's Java)</td>

					<tr>
						<th>Languages</th>
						<td>Java, GLSL (shaders)</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
I did everything in this game, from game code to most of the "art".
				</p>
				<p>
This project started as a school assignment to train myself programming and also discover game programming,
making a real-time engine, learning the basics of openGL, 3D mathematics and so much more.
				</p>
				<p>
This game was my first introduction to "real" game programming. I did make many other little forgotten games in the past,
but most of them were made without a game programming set of mind (they were basically very slow, not optimized and really hard to work with).
				</p>
				<p>
I intended the engine to be as easy to use and as intuitive as possible. That way, I could use it again to make more games.
				<p>
It features :
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fully working 3D game engine.</li>
					<li>Character movements and simple collisions with the world and other entities.</li>
					<li>Map generator (from custom file or random dungeon generation with seed).</li>
					<li>Fully working sprite animations with configurable file.</li>
					<li>Particle systems.</li>
					<li>Doors.</li>
					<li>Weapons.</li>
					<li>Menus.</li>
					<li>Prototype for A.I with pathfinding.</li>
					<li>And so many other things I can't list</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
You will be able to find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Gaktan/Wolfen-Doo" target="_blank">
GitHub</a>, as well as the game executable if you would like to try.
				</p>
				<p>
Here are some videos to show what the game is like. Disclaimer: framerate issues are actually caused by the recording software.
